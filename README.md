# Multiple Screens!

In this project I developed a contacts app.
The start screen will be the list of current saved contacts with each contact's name, number and photo.
You can edit or delete a current contact and you can add a new contact.
Usage:
1. Select edit button from start screen and choose the contact you want to delete, and you can delete it.
2. Tap the contact you want to modify and it will call a editing screen, on the editing screen, you can modify name, number and photo and then choose to save and update it or cancel actions
3. Select add button from start screen and you can add a new contact, on the adding screen, you can modify name, number and photo and then choose to save and add it or cancel actions
